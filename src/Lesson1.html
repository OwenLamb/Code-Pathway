            <p>Lesson 1 Introduction to Python</p>
            <p id="LessonPlan">    Python is one of the most used programming languages currently in the world. 
                It is one of the best languages for beginners because of how easy and forgiving the language 
                is. The reason being is that Python includes a comprehensive library installed with the language. 
                One of pythons greatest strengths is a wide array of libraries it has at its disposale. This 
                allows users to who don't have the expertise or time to program specific functions or classes to 
                seamlessly plug in functionality into their code. But we're getting ahead of ourselves so lets 
                start at the beginning.

            <p>Hello World</p>
            <p id="LessonPlan">   Every programmer when they learn a new language does one line of code first. 
                That line is printing to the console "Hello World". Do do that in python you simply type:
            </p>
            <p id="LessonPlan">
                print("Hello World")
            </p>
