            <p><b>Lesson 3: Introduction to Loops</b></p>

            <p id="LessonPlan">   
                In programming there are two main kinds of loops. A for loop and a while loop. A while loop will first check condition and if it's true
                then run the code inside of it. Once it reaches the end it will check the condition again, loops can run infinitely so make sure it's able to 
                exit when intended. For loops do the same steps except in python they are designed explicitly for iteration. Iterating through a list of values for example.
            </p>

            <p id="LessonPlan"> 
                Here is an example of both a while and a for loop:
            </p>

            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
whileIndex = 0

while (whileIndex != 10):
    whileIndex =+ 1
    print("Hello")

ListOfNames = ["Jack", "John", "Ron"]

for (index in ListOfNames):
    print(index)
                </pre>
            </div>

            <p id="LessonPlan">
                In the while loop the text Hello is printed 10 times. In the for loop each named is printed one after another starting with "Jack"
            </p>

            <p id="LessonPlan">
            Loops are powerful tools for creating code that can go through each possible iteration easily.
            </p>
